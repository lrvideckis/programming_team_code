  - note `-Wconversion` is missing
- [library-checker-tests/](https://github.com/lrvideckis/Programming-Team-Code/tree/master/tests/library-checker-tests) which tests code on [Library Checker](https://judge.yosupo.jp/) ([steps to setup](https://online-judge-tools.github.io/verification-helper/installer.html))
- [stress-tests/](https://github.com/lrvideckis/Programming-Team-Code/tree/master/tests/stress-tests) which compares library code output to a naive version (or another alg) on random inputs.
-  Not all code is tested; see test status comments at the top of each file.
