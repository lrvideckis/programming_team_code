## Cron jobs:
1) [rerun_lib_checker_tests_daily.yml](../.github/workflows/rerun_lib_checker_tests_daily.yml) runs at midnight (PDT) and removes the file [timestamps.remote.json](../.verify-helper/timestamps.remote.json)
2) [run_tests_scheduled.yml](../.github/workflows/run_tests_scheduled.yml) runs `oj-verify all` every 30 minutes between midnight and 5am.
3) [check_all_tests_ran.yml](../.github/workflows/check_all_tests_ran.yml) runs at 5am and checks that all tests have run.

- Main reason 1: occasionally Library Checker [adds new tests](https://github.com/yosupo06/library-checker-problems/issues?q=label%3Atestcase). So now the lib will be tested on all newly added tests.
- Main reason 2: sometimes I do a code-mod style change which affects many files, and thus many tests have to be re-run. But `oj-verify all` only runs 10-20 tests per commit, potentially leaving some un-run tests. Before, I used to make timely-commits which changed effectively nothing, but caused more tests to rerun. Now I don't have to do this.
- Side reason: Library Checker generates tests randomly, so rerunning tests means the code is tested on more random data.

## Doxygen
Let's try to minimize the # of non-doxygen comments.

Needed for doxygen to see global functions
```
/** @file */
```
Place this directly before a struct or function.

```
/**
 * @see <link to some source>
 *
 * Name, description, and/or any notes/tricks. It's okay if this is multiple
 * lines; wrap like this.
 * @code{.cpp}
       //example usage or initialization
       vector<int> arr;
 * @endcode
 * @param le,ri defines range [le, ri)
 * @returns Sum of range.
 * @time O(n * sqrt(n log n)) I don't care about formatting as long as it's
 * clear. Ex: O(log n * k) could either mean O(log(n) * k) or O(log(nk)) - bad.
 * @space O(n ^ (3/2)) note space complexity is always <= time complexity because
 * you can "reuse" space, but you can't "reuse" time. Unless you can travel back in
 * time, then you could have larger space complexity.
